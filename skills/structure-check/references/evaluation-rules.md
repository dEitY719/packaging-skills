# claude-plugin-structure-check: Evaluation Rules

Detailed mode detection and scoring logic.

## Mode Detection Algorithm

Detect the layout mode by the following priority order:

1. **CLI flag** — `--single` or `--mono` forces the mode; mutually exclusive
   (last wins if both given).
2. **`marketplace.json`** — inspect `plugins[].source` field:
   - `"./"` → `single`
   - `"./plugins/.."` → `mono`
3. **Filesystem fallback** — presence of a `plugins/` directory → `mono`;
   otherwise → `single`.
4. **Ambiguous** → defaults to `mono` (report header notes `(추정)`).

## Plugin Root + Skill Discovery

A **plugin root** is the directory holding `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `skills/`.

- `mono` mode → each `plugins/*/` directory is a plugin root.
- `single` mode → repo root `./` is the plugin root (exactly one).

**Skills** (both modes, dynamic — never hard-code names): `<root>/skills/*/`
→ each subdirectory is a skill of that plugin root.

Record the detected mode, plugin-root list, and skill list for the report
header and the per-skill recommended checks (R1/R2/R5).

## Evaluation Scoring Rules

For each item in `references/structure-spec.md`, assign exactly one of:

- **PASS** — present and valid.
- **WARN** — recommended item missing/violated (R1-R8 only).
- **FAIL** — mandatory item missing/invalid (M1-M10 only).
- **N/A** — the subject does not exist (e.g. a plugin with 0 skills → its
  R1/R2 are N/A, not FAIL).

## Per-Item Evaluation Details

### M1-M10 (Mandatory — FAIL if violated)

M2/M3/M4 check **paths** are mode-dependent (see the spec's per-mode M-grid);
IDs, counts, and validation logic are identical across modes. M5/M6 and
R1/R2/R5 are mode-independent — only the skill-discovery path is plugin-root
relative.

**JSON validity (M1, M3):** parse with `python3 -m json.tool` (or `jq`); a
parse error is FAIL, not WARN.

**Frontmatter validity (M4):** the SKILL.md must have both `name:` and
`description:` keys.

**marketplace source integrity (M7-M9):** parse `.plugins[]` with `jq`. All
three are **N/A** when M1 fails (unreadable) or 0 plugins are listed — M1/M2
own those FAILs.

- **M7** — each element must resolve to a source: a bare string is the source;
  an object must carry its own `source` key. Any object lacking `source` → FAIL
  (the claude-plugin-jira#61 install-fail shape — the top-level `source` is
  **not** inherited at install time).
- **M8** — validate each resolved source's shape: a local path (`"."`, `"./"`,
  `"plugins/*"`, `"./plugins/*"`) or a git-URL object
  (`{ "source":"url", "url":"<non-empty>" }`). Any other shape → FAIL. Skip
  elements with no resolvable source (M7 owns them) — never a double FAIL.
- **M9** — mono only: for each `./plugins/<name>` source, `plugins/<name>/`
  must exist on disk (declared-but-absent → FAIL). Remote url-type sources are
  skipped; `single` mode and all-remote mono repos → N/A. This never re-flags a
  valid remote setup (the #63 misdiagnosis guard).

**plugin.json known-field whitelist (M10):** for each plugin root's
`plugin.json`, compare its top-level `keys` against the known-field set
(`jq --argjson k '<set>' '[keys[]|select(. as $x|$k|index($x)|not)]|length'`).
Any key outside the set → FAIL (the claude-plugin-jira#65 `skills`-array case:
installs but the manifest fails validation at load). Known fields (2.1.x):
`name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`,
`license`, `keywords`. Missing/invalid manifest → M3 owns it (skipped); no
valid manifest → N/A. SSOT: `_CPS_PLUGIN_JSON_KNOWN_FIELDS` in the bats fixture.

### R1-R8 (Recommended — WARN if violated)

**R3/R4/R5** use the heuristics defined in `references/structure-spec.md`.

**R5:** for each discovered skill `<s>`, grep `README.md` for both a
`skill-guides/<s>.html` and a `skill-output/<s>-usage.{html,md}` path string
(relative or Pages-absolute) — missing either → WARN; no skills → N/A.

**R6:** `marketplace.json` has a top-level `$schema` key → else WARN; N/A when
unreadable.

**R7:** `marketplace.json` has a non-empty top-level `description` AND every
**object** plugin carries a non-empty `homepage` → else WARN. String-form
plugins are exempt from the homepage check; N/A when unreadable.

**R8:** if `README.md` contains a `/plugin marketplace add <URL>` line, PASS
when the URL points at the raw `marketplace.json` (or any non-`.git` URL), WARN
when it is a `.git` clone URL. No such line, or no README → N/A.

## Summary Verdict Logic

- any FAIL → **FAIL**
- no FAIL but ≥1 WARN → **WARN**
- all PASS/N/A → **PASS**

Emit the next-action hint **only when** there is ≥1 FAIL or WARN.
