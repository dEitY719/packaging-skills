# claude-plugin Structure Auditor

## Help

If arg #1 is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and output
its content verbatim, then stop. No filesystem scan.

## Step 1: Parse Args + Resolve Repo Path

- Positional `[repo-path]` → audit that path. None → audit the current
  directory.
- Flags `--single` / `--mono` → force the layout mode, overriding
  auto-detection (Step 2). Mutually exclusive; if both given, last wins.
- Confirm the path exists; if not, stop with a one-line error pointing to
  `/packaging:structure-check path/to/repo`.
- Check `test -d <path>/.git`; not a git repo → continue, but note it
  (one warning line — the audit still runs).

## Step 2: Detect Mode + Discover Plugin Roots + Skills

Read `references/structure-spec.md` for the full standard (embedded SSOT) —
see "Layout modes", "Mode detection", and "Mandatory items by mode".

For detailed evaluation rules and mode/type classification logic: see [references/evaluation-rules.md](references/evaluation-rules.md)

Record the detected mode, plugin-root list, and skill list for the report
header and the per-skill recommended checks (R1/R2/R5).

## Step 3: Evaluate M1-M10 and R1-R8

Apply PASS/WARN/FAIL/N/A to each item per the scoring rules in
[references/evaluation-rules.md](references/evaluation-rules.md). Mandatory
items M1-M10 fail when missing — including M7-M9 marketplace `plugins[].source`
install integrity and M10 `plugin.json` known-field schema (#1084). Recommended
items R1-R8 warn. Full item-by-item table: `references/help.md`.

## Step 4: Output the Report

Read `references/report-template.md` for the exact format. The report has a
header line (path + detected mode + discovered plugins/skills), a `[필수]`
block (M1-M10) and a `[권장]` block (R1-R8), then the summary verdict:

- any FAIL → **FAIL**
- no FAIL but ≥1 WARN → **WARN**
- all PASS/N/A → **PASS**

Emit the next-action hint **only when** there is ≥1 FAIL or WARN. Always append
the "structure-check PASS ≠ install/runtime 성공" disclaimer (report-template.md
→ "Install/runtime disclaimer", #1084).

## Constraints

- Read-only — never create, move, or edit any file. Fixing is
  `packaging:structure-refactor`'s job.
- N/A is not FAIL — a missing *subject* (no skills, no plugins beyond M2)
  yields N/A for dependent checks.
- Do not audit SKILL.md *content* (that is `skill:check`) or shell script
  quality (that is `sh:check`) — only the directory structure.
- Repo-agnostic: detect mode + discover plugin roots/skills by scan; the
  spec is embedded, not read from the target repo. A `--single`/`--mono`
  override means "score by *that* mode" — a wrong override surfaces as a
  normal M2 FAIL, never a silent skip.
