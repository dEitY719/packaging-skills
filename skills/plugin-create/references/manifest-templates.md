# packaging:plugin-create — Manifest, LICENSE & .gitignore Templates

These are written in Step 5 (`mono` golden layout). `<plugin-name>` is the
repo name (`claude-plugin-harness`); `<plugin>` is the plugin key
(`harness`); `<owner>`/`<host>` come from the flags; `<skill>` entries come
from the dynamically discovered skill list. Keep `marketplace.json`
`name` equal to the repo name 1:1 (same rule as `packaging:rename-repo`).

## `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

```json
{
  "name": "<plugin-name>",
  "owner": "<owner>",
  "description": "<one-line marketplace description>",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "<plugin>",
      "source": "./plugins/<plugin>",
      "description": "<plugin description>"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `source` is a **relative** path (`./plugins/<plugin>`) — repo-name
independent, so a later `rename-repo` never has to touch it.

## `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

```json
{
  "name": "<plugin>",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "<plugin description>",
  "maintainer": "<owner>",
  "keywords": ["claude-plugin", "<domain>"],
  "category": "skills",
  "skills": ["./skills/<skill>"]
}
```

Fill `skills[]` from the copied skill list (one `./skills/<skill>` per
skill). Start at `version: "0.1.0"`.

## `LICENSE` (MIT, current year)

Derive the year at runtime (`date +%Y`) — do not hardcode it.
